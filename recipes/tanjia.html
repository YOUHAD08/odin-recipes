    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>  
    <p><i>Tanjia Marrakchia is a traditional Moroccan dish from Marrakech, slow-cooked to perfection with spices and tender meat, creating a rich and flavorful experience.</i></p>  
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>  
    <ul>  
        <li>1.5 kg lamb shoulder or beef, cut into large pieces</li>  
        <li>6 cloves of garlic, minced</li>  
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>  
        <li>1 tablespoon ground coriander</li>  
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>  
        <li>1 preserved lemon, cut into quarters</li>  
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>  
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>  
        <li>1-2 cups water</li>  
        <li>Optional: fresh parsley or cilantro for garnish</li>  
    </ul>  

    <h2>Directions</h2>  
    <ol>  
        <li>Preheat your oven to 150°C (300°F) if you’re using one, or prepare a small fire for traditional cooking.</li>  
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the minced garlic, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Rub this mixture thoroughly over the pieces of lamb or beef.</li>  
        <li>Place the seasoned meat into a tanjia pot (or a Dutch oven if you don't have a tanjia) and add the preserved lemon quarters. Drizzle with olive oil.</li>  
        <li>Add enough water to the pot to submerge the meat halfway. Cover the pot with its lid, sealing it to keep the moisture in.</li>  
        <li>If using an oven, cook for about 3-4 hours, or until the meat is very tender. If using traditional cooking, bury the pot in the hot ashes and cook for the same duration.</li>  
        <li>Once done, carefully uncover the pot and check the seasoning. Serve hot, garnished with fresh parsley or cilantro if desired.</li>  
    </ol>  

    <h2>Serving Suggestion</h2>  
    <p>Serve the Tanjia with Moroccan bread to soak up the delicious sauce.</p>
